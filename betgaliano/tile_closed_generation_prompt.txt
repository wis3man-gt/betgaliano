DEFAULT/CLOSED MINES TILE — FINAL GENERATION PROMPT

Create a single square stone tile asset for a Mines game UI.

Composition:
- One tile only, centered in frame
- Strict top-down orthographic view (90-degree overhead)
- No perspective tilt, no isometric angle
- Symmetrical, grid-friendly silhouette
- Consistent edge thickness on all 4 sides

Style:
- Stylized 3D polished game-art look
- Dark bluish stone material
- Rounded corners
- Soft, controlled lighting
- Clean, readable cracks and rock detail (avoid heavy noise)
- Keep center region visually cleaner/less detailed for later SVG/logo overlay
- No emblem/logo in center

Negative constraints:
- No hover glow
- No red danger glow
- No particles, props, environment, scene, shadows on floor, UI frame, text, watermark
- No multiple tiles

Output requirements:
- PNG style output
- Plain solid white background (#FFFFFF) for easy background removal
- Tile should remain readable when downscaled to small UI sizes (e.g., 64–96 px)

Recommended generation settings (if tool supports):
- Aspect ratio: 1:1
- Camera: orthographic / top view / overhead 90°
- Stylization: medium (retain clean forms)
- Detail: medium-high on edges, medium-low in center
- Contrast: medium

Optional one-line short prompt:
"Single centered square dark-blue stone game tile, strict top-down 90° orthographic view, rounded corners, stylized polished 3D game art, clean readable cracks, clean center area for icon overlay, symmetrical edges, no glow, no logo, no text, plain white background, PNG-ready."
